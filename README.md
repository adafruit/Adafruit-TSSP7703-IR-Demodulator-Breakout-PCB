### Description

While designing our IR decoding breakout we noticed the TSSP series of chips from Vishay, these are simpler than more 'remote control' receivers in that they don't do any filtering on the codes received: you really just get the demodulated-from-38KHz-signal output.

According to Vishay, they're designed for "Reflective Sensing, Light Barriers, and Fast Proximity Applications". These sensors could be interesting for use when you want a less-'intelligent' IR decoder, or for proximity projects where you don't want to go all-out for a VCNL I2C sensor. These are good for creating break-beams where the IR light is modulated rather than just solid on, because you won't be affected by other IR signals or ambient light changes.

This board will work nicely for a variety of IR detecting projects, and with mounting holes and a cable, a lot easier to mount in enclosures and on devices. Using a 2mm pitch STEMMA JST PH cable with headers or alligator clips on the end, you can easily wire this board without any soldering.

Note that this board is specifically for proximity sensing or break-beam projects, while it can receive 38KHz IR remote control signals - there isn't a filter system so you'll get a lot of spurious signals.

Each STEMMA board is a fully assembled and tested PCB but no cable. No soldering is required to use it, but you will need to pick up a 2mm pitch, 3-pin STEMMA JST PH cable. Alternatively, if you do want to solder, there's a 0.1" spaced header for power/ground/signal.
